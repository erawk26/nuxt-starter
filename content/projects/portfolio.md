  I built my portfolio with ES6 VanillaJS and Vue. It leverages Webpack to
  compile all my code, images, and single file components into a nice optimized
  bundle that is cross browser compatible and easy to deploy. I really enjoy working
  in Vue and I think single file components could be the future of web development.

I built my portfolio with ES6 VanillaJS and Vue. The nexest version is using Nuxt for server side rendering. It leverages Webpack to compile all my code, images, and single file components into a nice optimized bundle that is cross browser compatible and easy to deploy. I really enjoy working in Vue and I think single file components could be the future of web development.
