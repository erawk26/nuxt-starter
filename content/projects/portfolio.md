title: Nuxt Portfolio
client: Erik the Developer
description: I've re-built my portfolio countless times to experiment with new technologies. This most recent iteration is done with Nuxt. Its been a lot of fun to build in! The contact form is sending through AWS lambda which lets me host the rest of the site through Github/Netlify and leverage their continuous integration server side rendering. Pretty cool.
